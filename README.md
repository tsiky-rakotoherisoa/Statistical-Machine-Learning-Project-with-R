# Statistical Machine Learning (SML)

This repository contains two R Markdown documents focusing on statistical machine learning techniques. The project explores applying advanced statistical models and methodologies to real-world data.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── tsiky_rakotoherisoa_SML1.Rmd    # Document 1: Statistical Machine Learning basics
└── tsiky_rakotoherisoa_SML2.Rmd    # Document 2: Advanced SML techniques and applications
```

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools and packages installed:

- R and R Markdown
- RStudio (recommended for working with .Rmd files)

Key R packages required:

- `tidyverse` (for data manipulation and visualization)
- `caret` (for machine learning workflows)
- `ggplot2` (for advanced visualizations)

To install the necessary packages, run the following in your R console:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "ggplot2"))
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/statistical-machine-learning.git
    cd statistical-machine-learning
    ```

2. Open RStudio and load the `.Rmd` files:

    - `tsiky_rakotoherisoa_SML1.Rmd`
    - `tsiky_rakotoherisoa_SML2.Rmd`

3. Execute the code chunks by clicking "Run" or render the entire document to HTML or PDF.
